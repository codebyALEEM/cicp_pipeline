# ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

This project documents my learning journey on how **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipelines work using **GitHub Actions** and **YAML configuration files**.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to understand the fundamentals of **automating workflows** — how GitHub Actions detect changes, run jobs, and manage builds automatically.

Through this project, I explored:

* The **structure and syntax** of `.yml` workflow files
* How GitHub **tracks repository events** and triggers pipelines
* Creating automated steps for setup, testing, and artifact upload
* The overall concept of **continuous integration and deployment**

---

## 🧩 Key Learnings

✅ **Understanding YAML** – Defined reusable and readable workflow instructions
✅ **GitHub Actions Workflow** – Automated tasks for build and test runs
✅ **Triggers and Events** – Used `on: push` and `on: pull_request` to control pipeline execution
✅ **Jobs and Steps** – Set up isolated environments to execute tasks
✅ **Artifact Management** – Learned how GitHub stores and retrieves build results

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **GitHub Actions**
* **YAML**
* **Python / Bash** (for workflow steps)

---

## 💡 Takeaways

* Learned how to **automate repetitive tasks** using GitHub Actions
* Gained practical experience in **configuring CI/CD pipelines**
* Built confidence in **workflow debugging and job orchestration**
